Welcome to Shelton's Bash Guide! This guide is organized using the **Diátaxis** framework:

## 📚 Structure

- **Concepts**: Core Bash topics like variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and file operations
- **Reference**: Authoritative, terse descriptions of builtins, syntax, and keywords  
- **Explanations**: Essays that connect concepts and clarify design decisions
- **Tutorials** (future): Step-by-step learning paths
- **How-to guides** (future): Task-oriented recipes

## 🎨 Theme

This guide features a beautiful **Nord** color scheme with both light and dark modes. Use the theme toggle (☀️/🌙) in the navigation to switch between:

- **Nord Light**: Clean, bright theme with snow storm colors
- **Nord Dark**: Cozy, dark theme with polar night colors

## 🔍 Search

Powered by Starlight's built-in search - just press **/** or **Ctrl+K** to search across all content.
